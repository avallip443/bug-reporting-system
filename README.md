## Overview

This program, the Bug Report System (BRS), is designed to facilitate the input of bugs and errors into a database, offering users a straightforward and user-friendly script for seamless implementation. A stable internet connection and specific network capabilities are required for optimal functionality of the web form. Users can initiate new bug reports and close them as needed, with email notifications provided at each stage of the bug repair process. Access to the bug report form requires logging in with a valid username and password. Additionally, a graphical representation of past bug occurrences and their frequency will be available. Upon bug resolution, notifications will be sent via email to the reporting developer and any other involved parties.

This package encapsulates the key components of the second iteration of the BRS development cycle, including a Product Backlog, a Test Plan, and a Team Velocity.

## Package Contents:

### **1. Product Backlog**

The product backlog for this iteration contains a prioritized list of features and enhancements for the BRS.  

More specifically, it contains: 

- **User Stories:** Contains all user stories for this iteration. User stories detail the functionality from an end-user perspective and prioritize them based on their importance to the product

- **Task Breakdown:** Specific tasks necessary for the implementation of each user story and includes key tools/technologies to use and essential functionalities.

- **Effort Estimation:** Estimated and actual effort values for each completed user story and task. Effort estimation helps in understanding the resources required for each item on the backlog and enables tracking of progress against initial estimates

- **Team Velocity Diagram:** A visual representation of the team's velocity, showing the amount of work completed in this iteration. This diagram aids in evaluating the team's productivity and in making informed decisions regarding future iterations.

 
### **2. Revised Estimates**

The "Revised Estimates" section provides updated time estimates for the remaining stories and tasks slated for iteration 3, taking into account the outcomes and learnings from iteration 2.

This section contains:
- **Updated Time Estimates:** Based on the outcomes and learnings from the previous iteration, the time required to complete the remaining stories and tasks for iteration 3 was reassesed.

- **Indicated Effort Estimates:** Clear indication is provided for the estimated effort required for all stories and tasks. By indicating the anticipated effort for each item, a outline for resource allocation and project planning was established.

- **Tracked Actual Effort:** Actual effort values for each of the finished stories and tasks from the previous iteration are documented. This allows for a comparison between the initially estimated effort and the actual effort required.

By consistently reviewing and updating our estimates based on the actual outcomes, there will be an increase to predictability and efficiency of BRS project planning and execution processes.


### **3. Test Plan**  

Describes the testing approach for the final iteration, ensuring thorough coverage of all features. Detailed test plan outlining:  

- **Test conditions:** Specific conditions under which each test will be conducted.

- **Test inputs:** Detailed inputs to be used for each test case.

- **Expected outputs:** Defined expected outcomes for each test to help with easy identification of discrepancies during testing.  

This plan is pivotal for ensuring the quality and robustness of the final iteration.  

### **4. ReadMe File**

The "ReadMe File" section provides a comprehensive overview of the contents and purpose of the delivery package for the current iteration.

This section contains:

- **Contents Description:** A detailed description of the contents included in the delivery package is provided. 

- **Purpose Clarification:** The purpose of the delivery package is clearly outlined, highlighting its intended use, functionality, and significance.

- **List of Team Members:** The names of all team members who contributed to this iteration are listed.
